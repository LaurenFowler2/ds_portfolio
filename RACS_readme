Rockbridge Area Community Services (RACS) Survey
 
  The RACS Survey was created during my community service-based class. As a class, we created a survey for RACS to help them understand from their clientele what they may need to improve upon &
what they are doing well. After the distribution of the survey, an analysis of the data was done, and a report was written suggesting ways RACS could improve.
